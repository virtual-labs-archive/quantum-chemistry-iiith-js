             In 1931, E. Huckel proposed molecular orbital theory, in which molecular orbitals are approximated
   using linear combination of atomic ortibals (LCAO) for \(\pi\)-conjugated systems. This approximation
   is called Huckel Molecular Orbital theory and is the basis for Huckel's \((4n+2)\) rule for aromaticity
   and for further developments in understanding the role of orbital symmetry in stereo-selectivity in
   organic reactions (Woodward-Hoffman rules).
   </p>
   <p>

   Because of its (a) simplicity and (b) ease of calculation and (c) its power in demonstrating easily 
   the electronic structure of conjugated hydrocarbons without any requirement of any physical constants, 
   this method has gained popularity in text-book resources.

         In Molecular Orbital Theory, one popular approximation is that of  Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals
   for Molecuar Orbitals (LCAO-MO), which can be mathematically represented as
   $$ \psi = \sum_i^{} ~~ c_i \phi_i $$
   where \(\psi\) is the wave function of the molecular orbitals and the \(\phi_i\) are the atomic ortibals 
    and the constants \(c_i\)
   are constats that are to be determined. The LCAO-MO has to satisfy the appropriate molecular Schrodinger 
   Equation, $$\hat H \psi = E \psi$$ Note that the individual atomic orbitals need not be eigen functions 
   of the molecular Hamiltonian \(\hat H\).
</p>
   <p>
   Use of variational principle to solve for this eigen system: <p>
   We know that the energy of the wave function \(\psi\) is given by 
   $$E = \frac {\int \psi^* \hat H \psi~d\tau } { \int \psi^* \psi~d\tau } $$ 
   which depends on the vaules of the coffecients \(\{c_i, i = 1,\cdots , N\} \).  
    Variational thorem tells  that the energy \(E\) has a minimum value, which are 
   given by calculating its derivative  and setting it to zero, i.e. 
  $$ \frac { \partial E} {\partial c_i} = 0, {\rm~for~each ~~}i = 1, \cdots, N,$$
  which gives  a set of \(N\) equations for each \(i\). 

  
   $$
E = \frac {\int \psi^* \hat H \psi~d\tau } { \int \psi^* \psi~d\tau } = 
           \frac { \int~d\tau~\left(\sum_{j=1}^N  c_j \phi_j \right) \hat H \left( \sum_{k=1}^N c_k \phi_k \right) }
                  { \int~d\tau~\left(\sum_{j=1}^N c_j \phi_j \right)  \left( \sum_{k=1}^N c_k \phi_k \right) }
$$ so that

$$ E  = \frac{ \sum_j \sum_k c_j c_k H_{jk} } {  \sum_j \sum_k c_j c_k S_{jk} } $$ where
\( H_{jk} = \int~d\tau~\phi^*_j \hat H \phi_k\) 
and 
\( S_{jk} = \int~d\tau~\phi^*_j \phi_k\). 
Variational Theoerm assures that \( E \) has a minimum which corrresponds to the 
energy of the ground state., so the condition that \( \frac { \partial E }{ \partial c_i} = 0 \) 
is satisfied for \(i = 1, \cdots , N\). Writing the above equation as 
$$ E \sum_j \sum_k c_j c_k S_{jk} = \sum_j \sum_k c_j c_k H_{jk} $$
 and now taking the derivative with respect to 
\(c_i\) (while keeping in mind that E is also a function of \(c_i\)) and using the fact that 
\( \frac {\partial E } { \partial c_i} = 0 \) at minimum we get 
$$ 2E \sum_j c_i S_{ij} = 2 \sum_j c_i H_{ij}, {\rm~for~each~}  i=1,\cdots,N. $$
This above equation can be rewritten to \( \sum_j c_i \left(H_{ij} - E S_{ij}\right)=0\). Defining Hamiltonian
matrix \(\bf H\) whose elements \( [{\bf H}]_{ij} = H_{ij} \) and the overlap matrix \(\bf S\) whose elememts 
\( [{\bf S}]_{ij} = S_{ij}\) we have already defined, and defining the the coeffecient vector 
\(\vec c = (c_1, c_2, \cdots, c_N)^T\), the above \( N \) equations for the minimum can be rewritten as 
$$ \left( {\bf H} - E {\bf S} \right) \vec c = 0. $$
Clealy, the unique solutions exists if and only if \( {\bf det} \left( {\bf H} - E {\bf S} \right) = 0 \). Note that while we have the matrices \(\bf H\) and \( \bf S\), we are yet to find out values for \( E\). To find these values, the determinant has to be expanded and the resulting \(N\)-th order polymomial in \(E\) has to be solved, which will give \(N\) roots. The lowest 
\(E\) value is the energy of the ground state.  
</p>
<p>
Huckel's approximation resulting in Huckel's Molecular Orbital Theory: 
<ul> 
<li> When the moleclues are planar, the \(\sigma\) bond orbitals and the \(\pi\) bond orbitals are perpendicular to each other (more specifically, \(\sigma\) bond orbitals lie completely in the plane, and the \(\pi\) bond orbitals lie perpenduclar to this plane). So assuming that the 
\(\sigma\) bonds are already formed, look at the electronic struture of the \( \pi \) bonds alone. 
<li>So essentially, each atom in the conjugated system contributes one \(\pi\) orbital, which we denote \( \phi_i \) in the above theory. These AO's (Atomic Orbitals) mix in a linear fashion to form molecular orbitals (LCAO-MO approximation).
<li> Consider the case where all atoms contributing to the conjugated \( \pi \) system are of same type (for example, carbon). The hamiltonian integrals \( H_{ij} =0  \) when atom \(i\) and atom \(j\) are not same or not neighbours. When atoms \(i\) and \(j\) are neighbours, \(H_{ij} = \beta\). And  \(H_{ii} = \alpha\)
<li> The overlap integrals  \( S_{ij}=0 \) when atom \(i\) and atom \(j\) are not the same and obviously \(S_{ii} =1\). That is, \( {\bf S} = {\bf 1}\). 
<li> As demonstration, for a linear chain,  we see the the equation for the roots secular determinant is simplified to \( {\bf det} \left( {\bf H} - E {\bf S} \right) = 0\):
$$ 
\begin{vmatrix} 
H_{11} - E S_{11}  & H_{12} - E S_{12} & \cdots & H_{1N} - E S_{1N} \\
H_{21} - E S_{21}  & H_{22} - E S_{12} & \cdots & H_{2N} - E S_{2N}\\
.       &  .     &  \cdots & . \\
.       &  .     &  \cdots & . \\
H_{N1} - E S_{N1} & H_{N2} - E S_{N2}& \cdots & H_{2N - E S_{NN}} \\  
\end{vmatrix}


=
\begin{vmatrix}
\alpha - E & \beta      & 0     & 0 & \cdots &  0  \\
\beta      & \alpha - E & \beta & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\
.          &   .        & .     & . & .      & .  \\
0          &   0        &  \cdots &\beta      & \alpha - E & \beta  \\
0          &    0       &    \cdots  & 0 &  \beta & \alpha - E \\
\end{vmatrix} = 0
$$
which upon solving will give \( N \) roots for \(E\), say \( E_j\), where  \(j = 1,2,\cdots,N\). Each such root will satisfy \(\left( {\bf H} - E_j {\bf 1}\right) \vec c_j = 0\). For each root \(E_j\), there exists a vector of coffecients \(\vec c_j\), which means that the molecular orbital for that energy is given by \( \psi_j = \vec c_j \cdot (\phi_1, \phi_2, \cdots,\phi_n)\) 
<li> Note that the above matrix has only two non-zero entries: \( \alpha-E\) and \(\beta\). Divivding by \(\beta\) on both sides and setting \( x = (\alpha-E)/\beta\) we see that the resulting determinant will have only two non-zero entries \(x\) and 1. This is is the terminology used in the experiment. (PLEASE NOTE THIS)</li>
<li> Hence, the equations need the solution to eigensystem. The eigenvector gives us the required coeffecients \(\vec c\)  of MO \(\psi_j\) having the energy given by the corresponding eigenvalue \(E_j\).
