$$x={-b±√{b^2-4ac}}/{2a}$$

		  Let the state of the system be represented by a vector \(\bf x\). For the 
		  mathematical convenience, below, a vector will be represented by a "column 
		  matrix" (a matrix which has only one row); i.e. \( \vec v = {\bf v}\). For this 
		  vector (column matrix ), the transpose is a row matrix represented as \( {\bf v}^T\).
