</h1>

<div id="introduction">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
Numerical computation in Quantum Mechanics (and quantum chemistry, in particular) uses the 
techniques and language of Linear Algebra, by usage of vectors, matrices and various 
operations on them.

<p> <br>
General Motivation: The wave function of a state of the system is typically represented by a vector 
( for the coeffecients) on a basis. The Operators are naturally represened 
as matrices over this basis. Since all properties are expectation values of the a particular
operators, we see that we are required to multiply a vector with a matrix. Thus understanding
matrix operations (on a vector, in particular) becomes paramount for understanding 
the numerical methodology of quantum mechanics. 

<p><br>
Application of variational theorem (in the matrix formulation) would require a
a solution to a set of linear equations; they are of  type 
\( {\bf A} \vec x = \vec b \), where matrix \( {\bf A }\) and vector \(\vec b\) are 
known, and a solution for vector \( \vec x \) has to be found. Also, the Schrodinger equation 
\(\hat H \psi = E \psi \) is also naturally converted to a matrix equation on a basis set 
\( {\bf H} \vec c = E \vec c \), which is an Eigen System. Understanding the solutions 
 for such Eigen systems are the main goal of this experiment.

<h2>Theory</h2>

 Please see the theory section of the Huckel Molecular Orbital theory, as an example of
how analyis of linear systems and an eigen system is solved to obtain the electronic structure
of the molecule/s.

<p><br> A system of linear equations of the type:
$$ \sum_{j=1}^{N}~ c_{ij} x_j = b x_j, ~for~each~i = 1, 2, \cdots,N$$
can be written in matrix formulation as:
$$ {\bf C } {\vec x} = b {\vec x}$$
where matrix \( {\bf C}\) has elements \(c_{ij}\) is the only known quantity in the equation; both  and \(b\) (which is a is scalar constant) and the vector \(\vec x\) are to be determined. The left hand side of the equation, \( {\bf C} \vec x\) can be thought of as an operation 
on the vector \( \vec x\), resulting in another vector given by the right hand side \( b \vec x\), which has the same direction as the original vector, but is scaled by a factor \(b\). 

<p><br> Rewriting the above equation, we get
$$ ({\bf C } - b  {\bf I} ) \vec x = 0 $$
where \(\bf I\) is the Identity matrix. Consider the case where a product of two scalar 
quantities equals zero; this would imply that either one or both of the scalars are zero. 
Similarly, for the case were \( {\bf M } \vec x =0 \), if we ignore the trivial solution 
\( \vec x =0\), the requirement is that the determinant of \( {\bf M}\) equal zero; i.e. 
$$ {\bf det M} = {\bf det} ( {\bf C} -b {\bf I})= 0$$
where the only unknown quantity is \(b\). This determinant  is a \(N\)-th order polynomial 
in \(b\), and will have \(N\) solutions for \(b\). 

<p><br>When the matrix \(\bf C\) is symmetric, we are assured that the roots of the 
equation \({\bf det} ( {\bf C} -b {\bf I})= 0\) are always real.

  <li> In the first stage, a matrix \(M\) is given. Note that the matrix is symmetric. 
The eigen values and eigen vectors of matrix \(M\) are given. 
In the applet to the right, you will be selecting vector \(P\) and notice the vector \(Q \) displayed, which is the calculated as \(Q = M P\) . Notice the ratio of projections of vector \(Q\) on the eigen vectors. Complete the quiz go to the next stage. 
  <li> In this stage, you will be selecting vectors \(P\) of same length, and notice the length of the resultant vector \(Q = M P\) .  When is the length of \(Q\) maximum or minimum ?
