		Substances appear to be of a particular color because its molecular constituents 
		are constantly emitting the light with a frequency corresponding to that color. 
		Dyes have very strong colors and have been used as coloring agents for clothes, food 
		etc. Extensively conjugated organic molecules have been used as dyes from ubiquity 
		and have their characteristic color corresponding the the transition between 
		electronic levels. Typically, the electronic transitions require very high energy and
		hence fall in far UV region. However, in conjugated organic molecules, 
		due to the extensive delocalization of the 
		pi-electrons in the molecule, the energies (and frequencies) of these transition 
		are lowered to near-UV and for some molecules to visible region. Such
		organic molecules (pigments) have color associated with this electronic transition.
		Shown below are some organic pigments and their structure.

	<p>
		Given a chemical structure, using Electronic Structure Theory, the energy levels 
		and hence the energies of transition between them and hence the color of the molecule
		can be calculated. However, such a Quantum Mechanical calculation is computationally
		expensive. On the other hand, the aim is to typically extract some structural 
		information from the spectra of a molecule of unknown structure. So a full Quantum
		Mechanical treatment is often not possible or at best uninformative. 
		The typical strategy used is to keep in mind some structural feature and use the
		data from the spectra as input into an appropriate ''model'' for which the energy
		levels and hence the spectra can be approximated to the experimental spectra, and
		obtain all other extractable structural parameters.
	</p> <br/>

	<p>
		For conjugated organic molecules, particle in a box model, which is one of the 
		elementary model in quantum mechanics particle in a box model is very suitable 
		because: (a) the conjugated pi-electrons are completely delocalised over the whole 
		conjugated chain (b) there is a clear separation of the energy levels corresponding 
		to the conjugated pi-system and rest of the molecule (ex: sigma bonds) (c) since the
		transitions corresponding to the conjugated pi-cloud are expected to be of the lowest
		energy transitions possible in these molecule.

		For conjugated organic molecules, particle in a box model, which is one of the 
		elementary model in quantum mechanics particle in a box model is very suitable 
		because: (a) the conjugated pi-electrons are completely delocalised over the whole 
		conjugated chain (b) there is a clear separation of the energy levels corresponding

		transitions corresponding to the conjugated pi-cloud are expected to be of the lowest
		energy transitions possible in these molecule.
	</p> <br>

	<p>
		For the particle of mass \(m\),  in 1-dimensional box of length \(m\),
		 the energy levels are
		quantized and are given in terms of the quantum number \(n\) as:
		$$E_n = \frac{n^2 h^2}{8mL^2} $$
		<br>
		where \(h\) is the Planck Constant, and \(n = 1, 2, 3, \dots\)
	</p> 
	<br>

	<p>
		The aufbau principle determines the order in which these energy levels are filled 
		and the Pauli exclusion principle restricts the number of electrons in a energy level
		to two. These two rules are sufficient to fill the conjugate pi-electrons in the
		available 1-d particle in a box energy levels and 
		determine the highest occupied energy level (called Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital, HOMO) 
		and the lowest unoccupied energy level (called Lowest Unoccupied Molecular 
		Orbital, LUMO). The lowest energy transition from the UV-Visible Spectra is associated
		to the transition energy of HOMO to LUMO transition for the electron. 
	</p> <br>

	<p> 
		The total length of the conjugated part of the molecule is determined 
		by using the model. From the structure of the molecule, the number of number of conjugated double
		bonds is known. Combining the above data provides an estimate of the the average double bond length, 
		as calculated by application of "particle in a box" model.
