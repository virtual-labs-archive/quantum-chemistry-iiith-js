Introduction:

Substances appear to be of a particular color because its molecular consitutents 
are constantly emitting the light with a frequency corresponding to that color. 
Dyes have very strong colors and have been used as coloring agents for clothes, food 
etc. Extensively conjugated organic moleucles have been used as dyes from ubiquity 
and have their charecteristic color correpsonding the the transtion between 
electronic levels. Typically, the electronic transitions require very high energy and hence fall in far UV region. However, in conjugated organic molecules, 
due to the extensive delocalization of the 
pi-electrons in the molecule, the energies (and freqencies) of these transition 
are lowered to near-UV and for some molecules to visible region. Such
organic molecules (pigments) have color associated with this electronic transition. Shown below are some organic pigments and their structure.

Given a chemical structure, using Electronic Structure Theory, the energy levels 
and hence the energies of transition between them and hence the color of the molecule
can be calculated. However, such a Quantum Mechanical calculation is computationally
expensive. On the other hand, the aim is to typically extract some structural 
information from the spectra of a molecule of unknown struture. So a full Quantum
Mechanical treatment is often not possible or at best uninformative. 
The typical strategy used is to keep in mind some structural feature and use the
data from the spectra as input into an appropriate ''model'' for which the energy
levels and hence the spectra can be approximated to the experimental spectra, and
obtain all other extractable structural parameters.

For conjugated organic molecules, particle in a box model, which is one of the 
elementary model in quantum mechanics particle in a box model is very suitable 
because: (a) the conjugated pi-electrons are completely delocalised over the whole 
conjugated chain (b) there is a clear separation of the energy levels correpsonding to the conjugated pi-system and rest of the molecule (ex: sigma bonds) (c) since the
transitions corresponding to the conjugated pi-cloud are expected to be of the lowest
energy transitions possible in these molecule.
