Given a chemical structure, using Electronic Structure Theory, the energy levels 
and hence the energies of transition between them and hence the color of the molecule
can be calculated. However, such a Quantum Mechanical calculation is computationally
expensive. On the other hand, the aim is to typically extract some structural 
information from the spectra of a molecule of unknown struture. So a full Quantum
Mechanical treatment is often not possible or at best uninformative. 
The typical strategy used is to keep in mind some structural feature and use the
data from the spectra as input into an appropriate ''model'' for which the energy
levels and hence the spectra can be approximated to the experimental spectra, and
obtain all other extractable structural parameters.

For conjugated organic molecules, particle in a box model, which is one of the 
elementary model in quantum mechanics particle in a box model is very suitable 
because: (a) the conjugated pi-electrons are completely delocalised over the whole 
conjugated chain (b) there is a clear separation of the energy levels correpsonding to the conjugated pi-system and rest of the molecule (ex: sigma bonds) (c) since the
transitions corresponding to the conjugated pi-cloud are expected to be of the lowest
energy transitions possible in these molecule.

For the particle of mass <em>m</em>,  in 1-dimensional box of length <em>L</em>,
 the energy levels are
quantized and are given in terms of the quantum number <em>n</em> as:

where <em>h</em> is the Planck Constant, and <em>n</em> = 1, 2, 3, ....

The aufbau principle determines the order in which these energy levels are filled 
and the Pauli exclusion principle restricts the number of electrons in a energy level
to two. These two rules are sufficient to fill the conjugate pi-electrons in the
available 1-d particle in a box energy levels and 
determine the highest occupied energy level (called Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital, HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied energy level (called Lowest Unoccupied Molecular 
Orbital, LUMO). The lowest energy transition from the UV-Visible Spectra is associated
to the transition energy of HOMO to LUMO transition for the electron.

Once the total length of the conjugated part of the molecule is determined 
by using the model, the typical double bond length can be estimated.
